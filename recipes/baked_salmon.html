                Baked salmon is a delicious and healthy meal that is both satisfying and nutritious. The salmon has a rich, buttery flavor that is enhanced when baked, with a slightly crispy exterior and a moist, tender flesh on the inside. The natural flavors of the salmon are brought out by the baking process, resulting in a dish that is both flavorful and savory.
